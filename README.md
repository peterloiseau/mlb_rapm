# mlb_rapm
Code and data for my project studying the utility of rapm methods in baseball. It is an attempt to account for opponent quality in batter/pitcher matchups.
The code contained in the .R file gives one the ability to pull the data and run the analysis done for the article. The .csv files are leaderboards which 
detail the output of the model and the transformations I made to make them more interpretable and account for small sample sizes.
